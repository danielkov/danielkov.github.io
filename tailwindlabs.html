      <h2>What I'm excited about...</h2>
      <p>
        I've been writing code since I was 12 years old. It's what I'm great at,
        but also what I love to do. A fulfilling career for me means sharing my
        knowledge and experience with others, and helping them grow. I'm excited
        about the opportunity to work with a team of talented engineers, writing
        code that reaches hundreds of millions of users, thousands of
        developers, and makes a true difference in the world. Tailwind has been
        my go-to CSS framework for the past 5 years. Contributing to its success
        on a daily basis would be a true honor.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always bet on open source culture as evidenced by my contributions to
        variety of open source projects, as well as my efforts to build a
        culture of open source within the teams and companies I work with.
        Joining TailwindLabs would mean a chance to work with people who share
        this passion, and to help build a product that is loved by developers
        around the world.
      </p>
      <h2>Interesting projects I've worked on...</h2>
      <p>
        I've been fortunate to get a chance to work on a large variety of
        exciting projects in the last 12 years. It's hard to pick just a few,
        but I'll try to highlight some that not only challenged me technically
        and helped me grow as an engineer, but also ones where my contributions
        had a significant impact on the product and the team.

      <h3>
        Full Rewrite of the Live Stream Client at
        <a href="https://livejasmin.com"
          >LiveJasmin <span class="text-red-600">(NSFW)</span></a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        The live stream client, also referred to internally as "chat client" is
        the core of the user experience at the adult streaming site LiveJasmin
        and in 2019, when I started on this project it was responsible for
        generating over 90% of the entire revenue of the company (~$700M). It
        was originally developed in 2001 and had undergone its first major
        transformation in 2010 after Steve Jobs' infamous "Thoughts on Flash"
        letter. The client was written in ActionScript, and was running on the
        Flash Player plugin. The company scrambled to come up with an
        alternative and that's how they ended up with a solution based on Haxe,
        which is sytactically similar to ActionScript, but compiles to
        JavaScript. The client was a monolithic application that was responsible
        for everything from rendering the video stream to handling the chat
        messages, and it was showing its age. The codebase was a mess, and the
        client was slow, buggy, and hard to maintain. It was also incredibly
        difficult to find AS3 developers in 2019, let alone people familiar with
        the obscure language that is Haxe, which - by then - had diverged quite
        a bit from its roots. A brilliant colleague of mine,
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andormade/">Andor Polgar</a>
        wrote a proposal to rewrite the client in JavaScript and I was chosen to
        architect and lead the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've decided to use TypeScript as the language of choice, due to its
        increasing popularity, and because I had great experiences with it in
        the past; although at that point, the company wasn't using it at all. It
        was a bet that paid off in the end, as the team quickly adopted to the
        language. We shared the workload by allocating tasks that required
        complicated typings - commonly referred to as "type gymnastics" - to the
        more experienced developers - mainly myself. I took care of abstracting
        complex typings behind utility types to make it highly understandable
        and usable at all levels of seniority.
      </p>
      <p>
        React became my choice of UI rendering library due to its popularity and
        because it followed precedent set by a handful of project prior to this
        one. React allowed us to move fast, while also giving us the flexibility
        to iterate on increasingly complex features, all while keeping
        performance in check. It also paired well with Redux, which I picked as
        the state management library for the project. Redux has a very shallow
        learning curve and it's very simple to test. Not only that but one can
        also use Redux just by itself. The lack of reliance on React for running
        business logic was a great boon, as it allowed other teams to use the
        core business logic of the library to develop their own clients using
        different technologies. One great example is the chat bot team, who used
        our Redux store in standalone mode to spin up a fully featured chat bot,
        using Node.JS and just 16 lines of code. Overall this project allowed us
        to deprecate over 1 million lines of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I'm particularly proud of this project, is because we pulled
        it off with a tiny team of just 3 engineers, including myself. On launch
        day, my contributions represented over 80% of the code base, however,
        well established contribution guidelines meant that it didn't feel like
        something only I could maintain. The code was clean. Although hacks were
        often necessary, especially to bring very old browsers in line, they
        were well documented and properly abstracted. For the first 3 months of
        the project's live operation, we've had zero bugs reported, which is a
        true testament to the power of a solid, modular architecture and a well
        tested codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most exciting part of this project was reverse-engineering decade
        old code, without documentation and often without access to the original
        developers. What made it even more challenging was the fact that we had
        to support an obscene range of browsers, including IE9, Safari 5.1, and
        Opera 12. The project was a great success, and it was a great learning
        experience for me. I've learned a lot about the importance of
        documentation, testing, and the power of a well-architected codebase.

      <h3>
        Vite Plugin for ESM Federation -
        <a href="https://github.com/superbet-group/vite-plugin-esm-federation"
          >Available on GitHub here</a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a much smaller project, but one that I'm proud of for a
        different reason. I've been working with multiple teams at Superbet on
        enabling and promoting microfrontends for about two years, when a
        colleague and I developed this idea of "browser-native" ESM federation.
        This is a take on
        <a href="https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy">Zack Jackson</a>'s module
        federation concept, but instead of relying on build tools to produce the
        necessary federation runtime, it relies on cutting-edge browser native
        features, such as ESM Dynamic Imports and Import Maps. The reason I
        researched and ultimately developed this idea was that the only
        available Vite Plugin that supported Module Federation at the time was
        developed by a Vue shop, called OriginJS and they frequently broke React
        support between releases. Being stuck on a lower version of this plugin
        meant we couldn't keep up with the release schedule of Vite. We couldn't
        realize bundle size savings and build time reductions and that prompted
        me to see if I can fix the Vite plugin.
      </p>
      <p>
        After working for a couple days on coming up with a fix into the
        OriginJS plugin I realized, I pretty much had to rewrite the majority of
        the core of the plugin. I did not want to propose the burden of having
        to test a massive rework of the plugin to a company that didn't even
        directly benefit from React support in the first place. Instead I
        decided to create a new plugin from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two reasons I'm proud of this. Firstly, a colleague
        <a
          href="https://github.com/originjs/vite-plugin-federation/issues/173#issuecomment-1461187444"
          >sent me this link</a
        >, which is a comment on one of the many React support issues on the
        OriginJS plugin's GitHub page. It mentions the plugin I wrote. I have
        more popular projects on GitHub, such as
        <a href="https://github.com/danielkov/gin-helmet">Gin Helmet</a>, which
        has a whopping 40 stars, but this is the first time I've seen someone
        mention one of my projects in the wild. I didn't intend for this to be
        used by anyone else, other than the teams within the company, so
        documentation is (to this day) internal, but it's a great feeling to see
        that someone found it useful. Secondly, I've learned a great deal about
        Vite, Rollup plugins and the Vite Plugin API, as well as some of the
        quirks of the latest ESM features in browsers. It took me less than a
        week from initial idea to a working plugin, which gave me a lot of
        confidence in my ability to quickly learn new technologies and apply
        them in practice.

        Superbundle - a tool for building microfrontends at scale, built in Rust
      </h3>
      <p>
        I wish I could say this project was a success, but it wasn't, hence why
        I'm not sharing a project page. It never made it past internal PoCs and
        MVPs. The reason why it came to mind is because it was the first time I
        used Rust in a professional setting. I've been a huge fan of the
        language for multiple years prior to starting this project, however I've
        failed to advocate for the use of it many times. Rust was the language
        that introduced me to the concept of developing an entire application in
        the IDE the resulting software working as intended on the first compile.
        A thrill I chase to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Superbundle was an all inclusive bundling tool, built on top of SWC,
        Tokio and an Axum server for development. I've designed it to be able to
        handle live updates across multiple different microfrontends, all
        running in their own sandbox, with the possibility of interoperating
        with a combination of dev mode and production mode microfrontends. It
        supported plugins via SWC and was able to bundle a 9MB minified
        non-gzipped frontend application in production mode in under 12 seconds,
        which was a huge improvement over the 6 minutes it took Webpack, or even
        the 1-2 minutes it took Vite to build the same codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key thing I've learned from this project is how fascinatingly
        complex React live updates are. Implementing them into this bundler was
        a true challenge. Most importantly I've learned to better evaluate the
        ROI of a fairly big project like this and to better communicate the
        value of it to the stakeholders. I've also learned that Rust is a great
        language for building tools, but it's not always the right choice for
        the job. I've learned to be more pragmatic in my technology choices, and
        to always consider the long-term maintainability of the codebase.

        This is an area I hope to keep improving in the future. I've contributed
        to a variety of projects, but I'm particularly proud of my contributions
        to the following:

      </h3>

      <p>
        I've used Gatsby for many years, mainly to build and maintain my
        freelancing portfolio site. On one occasion, I've stumbled upon a bug
        while updating my site to the latest version of Gatsby. I've decided to
        investigate the issue and see if I can fix it. Sure enough, after a
        couple minutes of tinkering, I've managed to make it function as
        expected locally.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've created a PR of the small fix and added some tests to cover the
        case. It was merged within a couple hours. I've also had some
        suggestions from one of the maintainers, and although I decided not to
        take that route with my fix, I appreciated the feedback and the time
        they've taken to review my PR.

      </h3>

      <p>
        As part of a huge community effort to migrate Gatsby from JavaScript to
        TypeScript, I took on the task of migrating the
        <code>gatsby-core-utils</code>
        package. The task itself wasn't particularly difficult. The biggest
        challenge was keeping up with coordination inside multiple channels,
        e.g.: GitHub Issues and Discord. This taught me the importance of
        clarifying communication channels, especially in large community-driven
        projects.

      <p>
        This is a tiny project I've built to solve a specific problem I had.
        It's interesting, because it's essentially "complete", in that the
        format won't change a whole lot, and the parser is very simple. I like
        the fact that despite its size I've made it very easy to use, basing it
        on the <code>JSON</code> API. It also has decent documentation.

        I've built this neat little middleware for the Gin web framework in Go.
        I was surprised to see it gain some traction, as it was a very small
        project, but I'm happy to see that it's being used by people. It has
        extensive documentation via GoDoc - something I like about Go - and it's
        very easy to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        7 years after publishing this library, I've decided to create a Rust
        version of it, called
        <a href="https://github.com/danielkov/rust-helmet">Rust Helmet</a>. I
        like the API of the Rust version even more than the Go version, and I'm
        excited to see where it goes. It also features a lot more extensive
        documentation than the Go version and it currently supports 2 web
        frameworks, with the ability to add support for more in a trivial and
        documented way.

      <h2>Technical Writing...</h2>

      <p>
        In case it wasn't obvious from the length of this page, I love writing.
        I wouldn't say I'm particularly good at it, but I enjoy doing it, and
        some say that's half the job. I've written a variety of articles over
        the years and I'm hoping to write more in the future. Here's a
